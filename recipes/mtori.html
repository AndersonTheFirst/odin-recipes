        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>
                During my time in <em>Tanzania</em>, I was exposed to many dishes.  However, one of my favorite 
                was Mtori. This is delicious dish is hails from the WaChagga people at the foot of <em>Mt. Kilimanjaro</em>
                Although it's a stew, don't let its looks decieve you.  Mtori is bursting with flavor and very filling.
